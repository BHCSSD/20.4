# Instructions:
For each exercise below, write a function that performs the required operation on a given sequence (list, string, etc.). Each function should return `42` at the start of its implementation to confirm it's working. After you complete your function, test it using the provided assertions to ensure correctness. If all assertions pass, print a message confirming the correctness of the exercise.


## Exercise 1: **first**

Write a function definition named `first` that takes in a sequence (string or list) and returns the first value of that sequence.

```python
def firstTest():   
    assert first("ubuntu") == "u"
    assert first([1, 2, 3]) == 1
    assert first(["python", "is", "awesome"]) == "python"
    print("Exercise 1 is correct.")
```


## Exercise 2: **second**

Write a function definition named `second` that takes in a sequence and returns the second value of that sequence.

```python
def secondTest():
    assert second("ubuntu") == "b"
    assert second([1, 2, 3]) == 2
    assert second(["python", "is", "awesome"]) == "is"
    print("Exercise 2 is correct.")
```


## Exercise 3: **third**

Write a function definition named `third` that takes in a sequence and returns the third value of that sequence.

```python
def thirdTest():
    assert third("ubuntu") == "u"
    assert third([1, 2, 3]) == 3
    assert third(["python", "is", "awesome"]) == "awesome"
    print("Exercise 3 is correct.")
```

## Exercise 4: **last**

Write a function definition named `last` that takes in a sequence and returns the last value of that sequence. Look online how to access the last item in a list or string

```python
def lastTest():   
    assert last("ubuntu") == "u"
    assert last([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 4
    assert last(["python", "is", "awesome"]) == "awesome"
    assert last(["kiwi", "mango", "guava"]) == "guava"
    print("Exercise 4 is correct.")
```

## Exercise 5: **second_to_last**

Write a function definition named `second_to_last` that takes in a sequence and returns the second to last value of that sequence.

```python
def second_to_lastTest():   
    assert second_to_last("ubuntu") == "t"
    assert second_to_last([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 3
    assert second_to_last(["python", "is", "awesome"]) == "is"
    assert second_to_last(["kiwi", "mango", "guava"]) == "mango"
    print("Exercise 5 is correct.")
```

## Exercise 6: **sum_all**

Write a function definition named `sum_all` that takes in a sequence of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers.

```python
def sum_allTest():    
    assert sum_all([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 10
    assert sum_all([3, 3, 3]) == 9
    assert sum_all([0, 5, 6]) == 11
    print("Exercise 6 is correct.")
```

## Exercise 7: **mean**

Write a function definition named `mean` that takes in a sequence of numbers and returns the average (mean) value of the numbers.

```python
def meanTest():
    assert mean([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 2.5
    assert mean([3, 3, 3]) == 3
    assert mean([1, 5, 6]) == 4
    print("Exercise 7 is correct.")
```
