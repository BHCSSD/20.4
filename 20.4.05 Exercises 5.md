## Exercise 1: **Sum of Numbers**

Write a function named `sum_of_numbers` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers using a `for` loop.

```python
def sum_of_numbers(numbers):
    return 42 
    

assert sum_of_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 10
assert sum_of_numbers([10, 20, 30]) == 60
assert sum_of_numbers([5, 7, 2]) == 14
print("Exercise 1 is correct.")
```



## Exercise 2: **Largest Number**

Write a function named `largest_number` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the largest number using a `for` loop.

```python
def largest_number(numbers):
    return 42 
    
assert largest_number([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 4
assert largest_number([10, 20, 30]) == 30
assert largest_number([5, 7, 2]) == 7
print("Exercise 2 is correct.")
```


## Exercise 3: **Reverse a List**

Write a function named `reverse_list` that takes in a list and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order using a `for` loop.

```python
def reverse_list(lst):
    return 42 
    
 

assert reverse_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [4, 3, 2, 1]
assert reverse_list([10, 20, 30]) == [30, 20, 10]
assert reverse_list([5, 7, 2]) == [2, 7, 5]
print("Exercise 3 is correct.")
```



## Exercise 4: **Product of Numbers**

Write a function named `product_of_numbers` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the product (multiplication) of all the numbers using a `for` loop.

```python
def product_of_numbers(numbers):
    return 42 
    
  

assert product_of_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 24
assert product_of_numbers([10, 2, 3]) == 60
assert product_of_numbers([5, 7, 2]) == 70
print("Exercise 4 is correct.")
```



## Exercise 5: **Even Numbers**

Write a function named `even_numbers` that takes in a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers using a `for` loop.

```python
def even_numbers(numbers):
    return 42 
    
 

assert even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [2, 4]
assert even_numbers([10, 20, 30, 1]) == [10, 20, 30]
assert even_numbers([5, 7, 2, 6]) == [2, 6]
print("Exercise 5 is correct.")
```



## Exercise 6: **Odd Numbers**

Write a function named `odd_numbers` that takes in a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers using a `for` loop.

```python
def odd_numbers(numbers):
    return 42 
 

assert odd_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 3, 5]
assert odd_numbers([10, 20, 30, 1]) == [1]
assert odd_numbers([5, 7, 2, 6]) == [5, 7]
print("Exercise 6 is correct.")
```


## Exercise 7: **Create a List of Squares**

Write a function named `squares_of_numbers` that takes in a list of numbers and returns a new list containing the squares of each number using a `for` loop.

```python
def squares_of_numbers(numbers):
    return 42 
    


assert squares_of_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 9, 16]
assert squares_of_numbers([10, 20, 30]) == [100, 400, 900]
assert squares_of_numbers([5, 7, 2]) == [25, 49, 4]
print("Exercise 7 is correct.")
```
