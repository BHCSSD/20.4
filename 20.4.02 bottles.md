# Ninety-nine Bottles (For Loops and While Loops)

**Project Overview**  
Create a Python program that prints the lyrics to "99 Bottles of Pop/Beer on the Wall." Start by using a `for` loop to handle the countdown, then modify the program to use user input and a `while` loop.

**File Setup**  
Name the file `NinetyNineBottles.py` (avoid starting the filename with a number, as this can cause errors).

## Requirements

### **Good Coding Practices (10%)**
- Follow PEP8 guidelines.
- Use proper indentation, comments, and user-friendly prompts.
- Both versions of your code should be contained in their own functions.
- Add a comment explaining the `for` loop.
  - What are the arguments in a for loop,, and how do we make it count backwards.
- Make use of `f strings` to help format your code
  -   **f-strings** (formatted strings) in Python let you directly embed variables and expressions inside curly braces `{}` within a string, making it simple to format text.
  -    Just add `f` before the string and include variables or expressions in `{}`.

```python
bottles = 99
print(f"{bottles} bottles of beer on the wall.")
```

 


### **Stage 1: Basic `for` Loop Lyrics (50%)**
- Create a `for` loop that counts down from 99 to 0 and prints the song lyrics.
- Each verse should dynamically include the current count in the lyrics.
- Example format:
  ```plaintext
  99 bottles of beer on the wall,
  99 bottles of beer.
  If one of those bottles should happen to fall,
  98 bottles of beer on the wall.
  ```
- The song should end with:
  ```plaintext
  1 bottle of beer on the wall,
  1 bottle of beer.
  If one of those bottles should happen to fall,
  0 bottles of beer on the wall.
  ```

### **Stage 2: Grammar Correction (10%)**
- Fix the grammar when thereâ€™s only one bottle left, so "bottles" changes to "bottle."
- Make it so if there is 0 bottles, your code reads "there are no bottles of beer on the wall"

### **Stage 3: User Input for Age and Preferences (20%)**
- **Ask the user for their age**:
  - If the user is 18 or older, ask if they prefer "pop" or "beer."
    - Use their choice in the lyrics ("99 Bottles of Pop on the Wall" or "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall").
  - If the user is under 18, default to "99 Bottles of Pop on the Wall" without asking their preference.

### **Stage 4: While Loop Version with User Input (10%)**
- Create a second version of the program that uses a `while` loop instead of a `for` loop.
- **Prompt the user to enter a starting number of bottles**:
  - Use this number to start the countdown.
- The lyrics and age-based drink preference should match the functionality of the previous version.
