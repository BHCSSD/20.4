 20.4.03 FizzBuzz
```

**Project Overview**  
Create a Python program that prints numbers from 1 to a user-specified limit. However, for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of 5, print "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."

---

## Requirements

### Clean Coding
- Use proper indentation, comments, and user-friendly prompts.
- Contain each version of your code in a separate function.
- Add a comment explaining how the `for` loop iterates through numbers and how the `if` statements determine when to print "FizzBuzz."
- Use `f-strings` where appropriate to format output.

```python
number = 15
print(f"{number} is divisible by both 3 and 5: FizzBuzz")
```
---
### Part 1: Basic `for` Loop FizzBuzz 
- Write a fnction called `forFizz()`
- Use a `for` loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to a fixed limit (e.g., 100).
- Print each number unless it meets one of the following conditions:
  - If the number is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead.
  - If the number is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead.
  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."
- Example output:
  ```plaintext
  1
  2
  Fizz
  4
  Buzz
  Fizz
  7
  8
  Fizz
  Buzz
  11
  Fizz
  13
  14
  FizzBuzz
  ```
---
### Part 2: User Input 
- Modify the program to ask the user for a number to define the range.
- Ensure the input is valid (a positive integer). If invalid, prompt the user again.
  - you can use a while loop for this. Please also take in the input of "exit" to `break` out of the loop   
- Example prompt:
  ```plaintext
  Enter a number: 50
  ```
  - The program should then print FizzBuzz up to 50.

### Part 3: While Loop Version 
- Implement a `while` loop version that functions the same as the `for` loop version.
  - the function name is `whileFizz`  
- Start from 1 and increment up to the user-specified number.
---
### Part 4: Custom Messages
- Ask the user if they want to use the for loop or the while loop version. 
- Allow the user to customize the words for Fizz and Buzz (e.g., "Boom" instead of "Fizz").

- Example prompt:
  ```plaintext
  Enter a replacement for "Fizz": Boom
  Enter a replacement for "Buzz": Pow
  ```
  - Example output:
    ```plaintext
    1
    2
    Boom
    4
    Pow
    Boom
    7
    8
    Boom
    Pow
    11
    Boom
    13
    14
    BoomPow
    ```


| **Criteria** | **Excellent (10 pts)** | **Good (7-9 pts)** | **Needs Improvement (4-6 pts)** | **Incomplete (0-3 pts)** |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Clean Coding** | Code follows PEP8, is well-indented, commented, and uses f-strings properly. Each version of the code is in a separate function. | Minor formatting issues, missing some comments, or minor redundancy. | Code runs but lacks comments, has poor indentation, or doesn't use f-strings properly. | Code is difficult to read, lacks structure, or is missing major clean coding practices. |
| **Part 1: `for` Loop FizzBuzz**  | `forFizz()` function correctly prints numbers, Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz in the right places up to 100. | Mostly correct, but with minor logic errors (e.g., FizzBuzz printed incorrectly in some cases). | Major errors in logic, missing FizzBuzz cases, or incorrect use of conditionals. | Code does not function correctly or is missing entirely. |
| **Part 2: User Input**  | Program asks user for a number, validates it correctly, and allows "exit" to break the loop. | Accepts input but has minor validation issues (e.g., doesn't handle some invalid input types well). | Partially works but has major issues (e.g., crashes on invalid input or doesn't exit properly). | No user input functionality or completely broken implementation. |
| **Part 3: `while` Loop Version**  | `whileFizz()` function works as intended, implementing the same logic as `forFizz()`. | Works but has minor logic issues (e.g., incorrect incrementing or condition handling). | Major logic errors (e.g., infinite loop, incorrect output). | No while loop implementation. |
| **Part 4: Custom Messages**  | User can choose between for/while loop versions and customize Fizz and Buzz words correctly. | Works but has minor issues (e.g., limited customization options or poor input validation). | Partially implemented but does not work correctly (e.g., does not replace words as intended). | No customization feature. |
