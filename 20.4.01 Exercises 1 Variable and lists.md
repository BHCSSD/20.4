# Python Variables and List Operations Assignment


- Make a new file in VScode edu and complete each exercise.
- Complete the following exercises by writing Python code to meet the requirements.
- Each exercise is implemented as its own function, and at the end of each function, `assertion` will check if your solution is correct.
- You are going to need to use a[ reference from W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) Python Tutorial to help answer these questions.

## How-To Guide:

Assertions:The assert statements check if your answer is correct. If false, an error helps identify issues and which exercise you had an error on.
**How-To Guide:**

1. **Variables:**  
   Variables store data using the `=` operator

2. **Boolean Values:**  
   Booleans (`True` or `False`) make sure to use capital T/F for this.

3. **Modifying Lists:**  
   Use methods like `append()` to add, `remove()` to delete, and `sort()` to arrange elements in order.
```python
   # Creating a list of fruits
fruits = ["mango", "banana", "guava"]

# Adding an item using append()
fruits.append("kiwi")
print(fruits)  # Output: ['mango', 'banana', 'guava', 'kiwi']

# Removing an item using remove()
fruits.remove("banana")
print(fruits)  # Output: ['mango', 'guava', 'kiwi']

# Sorting the list in alphabetical order
fruits.sort()
print(fruits)  # Output: ['guava', 'kiwi', 'mango']

```
4. **Combining Lists:**  
   Merge lists using the `+` operator or `extend()` method to organize related data efficiently.
```python
fruits = ["mango", "banana", "guava"]
vegetables = ["carrot", "broccoli", "zucchini"]

fruits_and_veggies = fruits + vegetables
print(fruits_and_veggies)  
# Output: ['mango', 'banana', 'guava', 'carrot', 'broccoli', 'zucchini']

fruits.extend(vegetables)
print(fruits)  
# Output: ['mango', 'banana', 'guava', 'carrot', 'broccoli', 'zucchini']
```
   
5. **Assertions:**  
   The `assert` statement are there to see if you get the assignments correct. If false, an error helps identify issues and which exercise you had an error on.



### Exercise 0
Uncomment the variable inside the function and run it.

```python
def exercise_0():
    # Uncomment the line below
    # doing_python_right_now = True
    
    assert doing_python_right_now == True, "If you see a NameError, it means that the variable is not created and assigned a value. An 'Assertion Error' means that the value of the variable is incorrect."
    print("Exercise 0 is correct")

exercise_0()
```

### Exercise 1
Create a variable named `on_mars_right_now` and assign it the boolean value of `False`.

```python
def exercise_1():
        
    assert on_mars_right_now == False, "If you see a Name Error, be sure to create the variable and assign it a value."
    print("Exercise 1 is correct.")

exercise_1()
```

### Exercise 2
Create a variable named `fruits` and assign it a list of the following fruits as strings: `mango`, `banana`, `guava`, `kiwi`, and `strawberry`.

```python
def exercise_2():
        
    assert fruits == ["mango", "banana", "guava", "kiwi", "strawberry"], "Ensure the variable contains all the strings in the provided order."
    print("Exercise 2 is correct.")

exercise_2()
```

### Exercise 3
Create a variable named `vegetables` and assign it a list of the following vegetables as strings: `eggplant`, `broccoli`, `carrot`, `cauliflower`, and `zucchini`.

```python
def exercise_3():
   
    assert vegetables == ["eggplant", "broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "zucchini"], "Ensure the variable contains all the strings in the provided order."
    print("Exercise 3 is correct.")

exercise_3()
```

### Exercise 4
Create a variable named `numbers` and assign it a list of numbers from 1 to 10.

```python
def exercise_4():
   
    assert numbers == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], "Ensure the variable contains the numbers 1-10 in order."
    print("Exercise 4 is correct.")

exercise_4()
```

## List Operations
Remember to use the reference from [W3Schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) to help answer these questions.

### Exercise 5
Using `append` add "tomato" to the end of the list `fruits`. Do not hard code the `tomato` into the list!!!

```python
def exercise_5():

    
    assert fruits == ["mango", "banana", "guava", "kiwi", "strawberry", "tomato"], "Ensure the variable contains all the strings in the right order."
    print("Exercise 5 is correct.")

exercise_5()
```

### Exercise 6
With `remove` delete "tomato" from the list `vegetables`. Use code, to do this, no hard coding. 

```python
def exercise_6():
    vegetables = ["eggplant","tomato", "broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "zucchini"]
 
    
    assert vegetables == ["eggplant", "broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "zucchini"], "Ensure the variable contains all the strings in the provided order."
    print("Exercise 6 is correct.")

exercise_6()
```

### Exercise 7
Reverse the list `numbers`. Take a look at [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_sort.asp) for ideas!i!!

```python
def exercise_7():
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
 
    
    assert numbers == [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], "Assert Error means that the answer is incorrect."
    print("Exercise 7 is correct.")

exercise_7()
```

### Exercise 8
Sort `vegetables` in alphabetical order. W3 school is your friend. 

```python
def exercise_8():
    vegetables = ["eggplant", "broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "zucchini", "tomato"]
    
    assert vegetables == ["broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "eggplant", "tomato", "zucchini"], "Ensure vegetables are sorted alphabetically."
    print("Exercise 8 is correct.")

exercise_8()
```

### Exercise 9
Sort `fruits` in reverse alphabetical order.

```python
def exercise_9():
    fruits = ["mango", "banana", "guava", "kiwi", "strawberry", "tomato"]
    
    assert fruits == ["tomato", "strawberry", "mango", "kiwi", "guava", "banana"], "Ensure fruits are sorted in reverse alphabetical order."
    print("Exercise 9 is correct.")

exercise_9()
```

### Exercise 10
Create a single list `fruits_and_veggies` that contains all `fruits` followed by all `vegetables`.

```python
def exercise_10():
    fruits = ["tomato", "strawberry", "mango", "kiwi", "guava", "banana"]
    vegetables = ["broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "eggplant", "tomato", "zucchini"]

    
    assert fruits_and_veggies == ["tomato", "strawberry", "mango", "kiwi", "guava", "banana", "broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "eggplant", "tomato", "zucchini"], "Ensure the final list combines all fruits and vegetables."
    print("Exercise 10 is correct.")

exercise_10()
```
