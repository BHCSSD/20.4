Do this in the sand box. 

You will be creating a simplified form of the dice game Yahtzee. In this version, the goal is to get 3 matching dice, and if you can't do that, then you hope to at least get 2 matching dice.
---
The game is played like so:

1. Roll 3 dice. `rollDice()`
   - think of this a rolling 1 dice return that number. 
2. If you do not have 3 matching dice: `playThreeDiceYahtzee()`
   - If you have 2 matching dice (a pair), keep the pair and roll one die to replace the third die.
   - Otherwise, if you have no matching dice, keep the highest die and roll two dice to replace the other two dice.
3. Repeat step 2 one more time.
4. Finally, compute your score like so: `calculateScore`
   - If you have 3 matching dice, your score is 20 + the sum of the matching dice. So if you have 4-4-4, your score is 20 + 4 + 4 + 4, or 32.
   - If you only have 2 matching dice, your score is 10 + the sum of the matching dice. So if you have 4-4-3, your score is 10 + 4 + 4, or 18.
   - If you have no matching dice, your score is the highest die.

With this in mind, write the function `playThreeDiceYahtzee()` that takes integer dice that represents all the rolls for a game of 3-Dice Yahtzee and returns both the resulting hand and the score for that hand.

## Important Hints/Helper Functions:
- reminder that random give you a float, you need to convert it to an integer for this to work or use randomint(). 
- `rollDice()`. Use this function to return an integer for your roll.
- `calculateScore()`. Use this function to return the score.
- `playThreeDiceYahtzee()`. Use this function to hold your logic of the game and print the output.

If you want to use the Unicode dice (⚀ ⚁ ⚂ ⚃ ⚄ ⚅), that is fine, just know you cannot do math with these, so only use them in the output.


```python
import random
num = random.randint(1, 6))## example of how to use randomint

def rollDice():
   pass

def playThreeDiceYahtzee():
   d1 = 0
   pass

def calculateScore(d1,d2,d3):
   pass

```
