# 20.4.01 Yahtzee

## Overview
You will create a simplified version of the dice game *Yahtzee*. The objective is to roll three dice and try to get three matching values. If that is not possible, the next best outcome is to get a pair.

## How to Play
1. **Roll Three Dice** (`rollDice()`):
   - This function simulates rolling a single die and returns a random number between 1 and 6.
   - While the main game uses three dice, this function is only going generate 1 dice, and you can use it to re roll multiple times. 

2. **Evaluate the Dice** (`playThreeDiceYahtzee()`):
   - If all three dice match, keep them.
   - If only two dice match (a pair), keep the pair and roll one die to replace the third.
   - If no dice match, keep the highest value die and roll the other two again.

3. **Re-Roll Based on the Same Rules**
   - If all three dice match after the second roll, keep them.
   - If two dice match after the second roll, keep the pair and roll the third die again.
   - If no dice match, keep the highest value die and reroll the other two once more.

4. **Calculate the Score** (`calculateScore()`):
   - If you have three matching dice, your score is **20 + the sum of the three dice**.
     - Example: Rolling `4-4-4` results in a score of `20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32`.
   - If you have only a pair, your score is **10 + the sum of the matching dice**.
     - Example: Rolling `4-4-3` results in a score of `10 + 4 + 4 = 18`.
   - If all three dice are different, your score is equal to the highest die value.

## Example Game Flow
1. **Initial Roll**: `3-5-5`
2. **Re-roll One Die (Keep the Pair)**: `5-5-2`
3. **Final Score**: `10 + 5 + 5 = 20`

## Implementation Guidelines

### Helper Functions
- `rollDice()`: Returns an integer between 1 and 6. 
- `calculateScore(d1, d2, d3)`: Computes and returns the score based on the final dice values.
- `playThreeDiceYahtzee()`: Manages the game logic and prints the results.

### Additional Notes
- Use `random.randint(1, 6)` to generate an integer roll.
- If you want to use Unicode dice symbols (⚀ ⚁ ⚂ ⚃ ⚄ ⚅), they can be included in the output, but they cannot be used for calculations.

## Example Code Structure
```python
import random

def rollDice():
    return random.randint(1, 6)

def calculateScore(d1, d2, d3):
    pass  # Implement scoring logic here

def playThreeDiceYahtzee():
    pass  # Implement game logic here
```
