# 20.4.07 Yahtzee  

## **Your Job:**  
- Roll three dice and try to get **three matching numbers**.  
- If you can't get three of a kind, the next best goal is to get **a pair**.  
- If all three dice are different, keep the highest one and reroll the other two.  



## **How to Play**  

### **1. Make Rolling the Dice (`rollDice()`)**  
- The game uses three dice, but this function only rolls **one** die at a time.  
- It returns a **random number between 1 and 6**.  
   - You will **call this function multiple times** to roll or re-roll dice.  

### **2. Deciding What to Keep (`playThreeDiceYahtzee()`)**  
After rolling three dice for the first time:  
- **If all three dice match**, keep them all, calculate the score.  
- **If two dice match (a pair)**, keep the pair and **re-roll the third die**.  
- **If all three dice are different**, keep the highest die and **re-roll the other two**.  

### **3. Re-Roll Using the Same Rules (`playThreeDiceYahtzee()`)**  
- **If all three dice match after re-rolling**, stop calculate the score.  
- **If two dice match after re-rolling**, keep the pair and re-roll the third die.  
- **If all three dice are different again**, keep the highest die and roll the other two once more.  

### **4. Scoring (`calculateScore()`)**  
The only thing your function here does is calculates and returns the final score

Your final score is calculated as follows:  
- **Three of a kind** → `20 + sum of all three dice`  
  - Example: Rolling **4-4-4** → `20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32`  
- **A pair** → `10 + sum of the two matching dice`  
  - Example: Rolling **4-4-3** → `10 + 4 + 4 = 18`  
- **No matches** → Score is just the **highest die value**  
  - Example: Rolling **3-5-2** → Score = **5**  

---

## **Example Game Flow**  
1. **First Roll:** `3-5-5`  
2. **Re-roll one die (keep the pair):** `5-5-2`  
3. **Final Score:** `10 + 5 + 5 = 20`  

---

## **Your Task: Write These Functions**  

### **1. `rollDice()`**  
- Returns a random number between 1 and 6.  

### **2. `calculateScore(d1, d2, d3)`**  
- Takes in three final dice values and calculates the score based on the rules.  

### **3. `playThreeDiceYahtzee()`**  
- Runs the game using loops and logic to handle rolling and re-rolling.  
- Uses `rollDice()` to roll dice and `calculateScore()` to find the final score.  
- Prints the dice rolls and the final score.  



## **Helpful Hints**  
- Use `random.randint(1, 6)` to roll a die.  
- Fully optional, if you want, you can use Unicode dice symbols (⚀ ⚁ ⚂ ⚃ ⚄ ⚅) to display rolls, but this will not work for calculations.  



## Starter Code
```python
import random

def rollDice():
    pass # change this to return a single dice

def calculateScore(d1, d2, d3):
    pass  # Implement scoring logic here

def playThreeDiceYahtzee():
    pass  # Implement game logic here
```
