# Python Variables and List Operations Assignment

## Instructions
Make a new file in VScode edu and complete each exercise.
Complete the following exercises by writing Python code to meet the requirements. Each exercise is implemented as its own function, and at the end of each function, assertions will verify if your solution is correct.
You are going to need to use a reference from [W3Schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) to help answer these questions.


### Exercise 0
Uncomment the line inside the function and run it.

```python
def exercise_0():
    # Uncomment the line below
    # doing_python_right_now = True
    
    assert doing_python_right_now == True, "If you see a NameError, it means that the variable is not created and assigned a value. An 'Assertion Error' means that the value of the variable is incorrect."
    print("Exercise 0 is correct")

exercise_0()
```

### Exercise 1
Create a variable named `on_mars_right_now` and assign it the boolean value of `False`.

```python
def exercise_1():
        
    assert on_mars_right_now == False, "If you see a Name Error, be sure to create the variable and assign it a value."
    print("Exercise 1 is correct.")

exercise_1()
```

### Exercise 2
Create a variable named `fruits` and assign it a list of the following fruits as strings: `mango`, `banana`, `guava`, `kiwi`, and `strawberry`.

```python
def exercise_2():
        
    assert fruits == ["mango", "banana", "guava", "kiwi", "strawberry"], "Ensure the variable contains all the strings in the provided order."
    print("Exercise 2 is correct.")

exercise_2()
```

### Exercise 3
Create a variable named `vegetables` and assign it a list of the following vegetables as strings: `eggplant`, `broccoli`, `carrot`, `cauliflower`, and `zucchini`.

```python
def exercise_3():
   
    assert vegetables == ["eggplant", "broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "zucchini"], "Ensure the variable contains all the strings in the provided order."
    print("Exercise 3 is correct.")

exercise_3()
```

### Exercise 4
Create a variable named `numbers` and assign it a list of numbers from 1 to 10.

```python
def exercise_4():
   
    assert numbers == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], "Ensure the variable contains the numbers 1-10 in order."
    print("Exercise 4 is correct.")

exercise_4()
```

## List Operations
Remember to use the reference from [W3Schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) to help answer these questions.

### Exercise 5
Add "tomato" to the end of the list `fruits`. 

```python
def exercise_5():

    
    assert fruits == ["mango", "banana", "guava", "kiwi", "strawberry", "tomato"], "Ensure the variable contains all the strings in the right order."
    print("Exercise 5 is correct.")

exercise_5()
```

### Exercise 6
delete "tomato" from the list `vegetables`. Use code, to do this, no hard coding. 

```python
def exercise_6():
    vegetables = ["eggplant","tomato", "broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "zucchini"]
 
    
    assert vegetables == ["eggplant", "broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "zucchini"], "Ensure the variable contains all the strings in the provided order."
    print("Exercise 6 is correct.")

exercise_6()
```

### Exercise 7
Reverse the list `numbers`.

```python
def exercise_7():
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
 
    
    assert numbers == [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], "Assert Error means that the answer is incorrect."
    print("Exercise 7 is correct.")

exercise_7()
```

### Exercise 8
Sort `vegetables` in alphabetical order.

```python
def exercise_8():
    vegetables = ["eggplant", "broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "zucchini", "tomato"]
    
    assert vegetables == ["broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "eggplant", "tomato", "zucchini"], "Ensure vegetables are sorted alphabetically."
    print("Exercise 8 is correct.")

exercise_8()
```

### Exercise 9
Sort `fruits` in reverse alphabetical order.

```python
def exercise_9():
    fruits = ["mango", "banana", "guava", "kiwi", "strawberry", "tomato"]
    
    assert fruits == ["tomato", "strawberry", "mango", "kiwi", "guava", "banana"], "Ensure fruits are sorted in reverse alphabetical order."
    print("Exercise 9 is correct.")

exercise_9()
```

### Exercise 10
Create a single list `fruits_and_veggies` that contains all `fruits` followed by all `vegetables`. Hint...  join...

```python
def exercise_10():
    fruits = ["tomato", "strawberry", "mango", "kiwi", "guava", "banana"]
    vegetables = ["broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "eggplant", "tomato", "zucchini"]

    
    assert fruits_and_veggies == ["tomato", "strawberry", "mango", "kiwi", "guava", "banana", "broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "eggplant", "tomato", "zucchini"], "Ensure the final list combines all fruits and vegetables."
    print("Exercise 10 is correct.")

exercise_10()
```
