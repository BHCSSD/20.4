# Function Exercises
For each exercise you need to write your own functions that pass each test case. 

Make sure to copy each test case into your code. 
## Exercise 1
Write a function named `absolute_value` that takes in a number and returns the absolute value of the provided number.
There is a built in function in python that will do this absolute value, take a look for it. 
```python
# Test Cases
def test_absolute_value():
    assert absolute_value(4) == 4
    assert absolute_value(-5) == 5
    assert absolute_value(positive_odd_number) == positive_odd_number
    assert absolute_value(positive_even_number) == positive_even_number
    assert absolute_value(negative_odd_number) == negative_odd_number * -1
    assert absolute_value(negative_even_number) == negative_even_number * -1
    print("Exercise 1 is correct.")
```

## Exercise 2
Write a function named `is_multiple_of_three` that takes in a number and returns `True` if the number is evenly divisible by 3, otherwise `False`. Hint... use mod

```python
# Test Cases
def test_is_multiple_of_three():
    assert is_multiple_of_three(3) == True
    assert is_multiple_of_three(15) == True
    assert is_multiple_of_three(9) == True
    assert is_multiple_of_three(4) == False
    assert is_multiple_of_three(10) == False
    print("Exercise 26 is correct.")
```

## Exercise 3
Write a function named `is_multiple_of_five` that takes in a number and returns `True` if the number is evenly divisible by 5, otherwise `False`.

```python
# Test Cases
def test_is_multiple_of_five():
    assert is_multiple_of_five(3) == False
    assert is_multiple_of_five(15) == True
    assert is_multiple_of_five(9) == False
    assert is_multiple_of_five(4) == False
    assert is_multiple_of_five(10) == True
    print("Exercise 3 is correct.")
```

## Exercise 4
Write a function named `is_multiple_of_both_three_and_five` that takes in a number and returns `True` if the number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5, otherwise `False`.

```python
# Test Cases
def test_is_multiple_of_both_three_and_five():
    assert is_multiple_of_both_three_and_five(15) == True
    assert is_multiple_of_both_three_and_five(45) == True
    assert is_multiple_of_both_three_and_five(3) == False
    assert is_multiple_of_both_three_and_five(9) == False
    assert is_multiple_of_both_three_and_five(4) == False
    print("Exercise 4 is correct.")
```

## Exercise 5
Write a function named `square` that takes in a number and returns the number times itself.

```python
# Test Cases
def test_square():
    assert square(3) == 9
    assert square(2) == 4
    assert square(9) == 81
    assert square(positive_odd_number) == positive_odd_number * positive_odd_number
    print("Exercise 5 is correct.")
```

## Exercise 6
Write a function named `add` that takes in two numbers and returns the sum.

```python
# Test Cases
def test_add():
    assert add(3, 2) == 5
    assert add(10, -2) == 8
    assert add(5, 7) == 12
    print("Exercise 6 is correct.")
```

## Exercise 7
Write a function named `cube` that takes in a number and returns the number times itself, times itself.

```python
# Test Cases
def test_cube():
    assert cube(3) == 27
    assert cube(2) == 8
    assert cube(5) == 125
    assert cube(positive_odd_number) == positive_odd_number * positive_odd_number * positive_odd_number
    print("Exercise 7 is correct.")
```

## Exercise 8
Write a function named `square_root` that takes in a number and returns the square root of the provided number.
There is a built in function to do this, but the better way is to go the power of `0.5` other wise you need to import the math module.

```python
# Test Cases
def test_square_root():
    assert square_root(4) == 2.0
    assert square_root(64) == 8.0
    assert square_root(81) == 9.0
    print("Exercise 8 is correct.")
```

## Exercise 9
Write a function named `subtract` that takes in two numbers and returns the first minus the second argument.

```python
# Test Cases
def test_subtract():
    assert subtract(8, 6) == 2
    assert subtract(27, 4) == 23
    assert subtract(12, 2) == 10
    print("Exercise 9 is correct.")
```

## Exercise 10
Write a function named `multiply` that takes in two numbers and returns the first times the second argument.

```python
# Test Cases
def test_multiply():
    assert multiply(2, 1) == 2
    assert multiply(3, 5) == 15
    assert multiply(5, 2) == 10
    print("Exercise 10 is correct.")
```

## Exercise 11
Write a function named `divide` that takes in two numbers and returns the first argument divided by the second argument.

```python
# Test Cases
def test_divide():
    assert divide(27, 9) == 3
    assert divide(15, 3) == 5
    assert divide(5, 2) == 2.5
    assert divide(10, 2) == 5
    print("Exercise 11 is correct.")
```


## Exercise 12
Write a function named `remainder` that takes in two numbers and returns the remainder of first argument divided by the second argument.  hint.... mod

```python
# Test Cases
def test_remainder():
    assert remainder(3, 3) == 0
    assert remainder(5, 2) == 1
    assert remainder(7, 5) == 2
    print("Exercise 12 is correct.")
```

## Exercise 13
Write a function named `sum_of_squares` that takes in two numbers, squares each number, then returns the sum of both squares.

```python
# Test Cases
def test_sum_of_squares():
    assert sum_of_squares(3, 2) == 13
    assert sum_of_squares(5, 2) == 29
    assert sum_of_squares(2, 4) == 20
    print("Exercise 13 is correct.")
```
